                <p>
                  This is the perfect entry-level headset for the tween who's finally serious about gaming. The 7.1 Virtual Surround Sound turns your kid into a positional-audio ninja—they'll hear exactly where the enemy footsteps are coming from, earning instant bragging rights. It's a true multitasker: with removable dual USB and 3.5mm cords, it works flawlessly across PC, PS5, and Xbox (full 7.1 glory on PC). The noise-cancelling mic ensures their teammates only hear their voice, not your calls for them to clean their room. Best of all? Soft memory foam earmuffs and an adjustable band mean zero "head squeeze" complaints during those all-day sessions. It's serious gear without the serious price tag.
